FreeDOS XCOPY command version 1.1
---------------------------------
Copies files and directory trees.

XCOPY source [destination] [/switches]

  source       Specifies the directory and/or name of file(s) to copy.
  destination  Specifies the location and/or name of new file(s).
  /A           Copies only files with the archive attribute set and doesn't
               change the attribute.
  /C           Continues copying even if errors occur.
  /D[:M/D/Y]   Copies only files which have been changed on or after the
               specified date. When no date is specified, only files which are
               newer than existing destination files will be copied.
  /E           Copies any subdirectories, even if empty.
  /F           Display full source and destination name.
  /H           Copies hidden and system files as well as unprotected files.
  /I           If destination does not exist and copying more than one file,
               assume destination is a directory.
  /L           List files without copying them. (simulates copying)
  /M           Copies only files with the archive attribute set and turns off
               the archive attribute of the source files after copying them.
  /N           Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an
               existing destination file and skips these files.
  /P           Prompts for confirmation before creating each destination file.
  /Q           Quiet mode, don't show copied filenames.
  /R           Overwrite read-only files as well as unprotected files.
  /S           Copies directories and subdirectories except empty ones.
  /T           Creates directory tree without copying files. Empty directories
               will not be copied. To copy them add switch /E.
  /V           Verifies each new file.
  /W           Waits for a keypress before beginning.
  /Y           Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an
               existing destination file and overwrites these files.
  /-Y          Causes prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing
               destination file.

The switch /Y or /N may be preset in the COPYCMD environment variable.
This may be overridden with /-Y on the command line.
